Overall Goal
The primary objective is to successfully integrate your local
@discourser/design-system with Figma Make by creating a set of "guidelines"
that allows Figma's AI to generate accurate, production-ready code based on
your design system.

The Core Problem
Your initial attempt at providing guidelines was unsuccessful because their
total size was massive (~839 KB across 33 files). This far exceeds the context
window that Figma Make's AI can effectively handle, leading to it ignoring the
rules, hallucinating incorrect code (like using Tailwind CSS), or failing
entirely.

The Solution: "Minimal Guidelines" (exp/v1)
The core strategy you and Claude developed was to abandon the comprehensive
documentation approach and instead create a hyper-efficient, minimal set of
guidelines focused on fixing the most common failure modes.

This new version, stored in guidelines/exp/v1/, has the following
characteristics:

- Drastic Size Reduction: The guidelines were shrunk by 99.2%, from ~839 KB
  down to just ~6.9 KB.
- Fewer Files: The structure was simplified from 33 files to just 2 core
  instruction files and a testing log:
  - Guidelines.md (1.3 KB): The main entry point containing only the most
    critical, non-negotiable rules.
  - quick-ref.md (5.6 KB): A "cheat sheet" containing decision trees,
    correct import patterns, and barebones examples for key components,
    prioritizing structure over prose.
  - TESTING-LOG.md (6.7 KB): A pre-made template to systematically log the
    results of your tests.
- Focus on Critical Failures: The new guidelines prioritize telling the AI
  how to avoid common mistakes, specifically:
  1. How to correctly use compound components (e.g., always use
     <Card.Root>).
  2. How to correctly apply the `colorPalette` prop to buttons.
  3. To use the design system's styling functions, not Tailwind CSS.

The Action Plan: Structured Testing
A clear, scientific testing plan was established to validate the new minimal
guidelines.

1. Test A (Experimental): Use the new, minimal exp/v1 guidelines.
2. Test B (Control): Use a small subset of the original, large guidelines to
   prove they are less effective.
3. Standardized Prompts: Run a set of specific, repeatable prompts for both
   tests, such as:
   - "Create a Card with a title and a primary button"
   - "Create a login form with email, password inputs and submit button"
4. Success Metrics: Use the TESTING-LOG.md template to track pass/fail
   criteria for each prompt, noting:
   - Were the imports correct?
   - Was .Root used for compound components?
   - Was colorPalette used correctly?
   - Was Tailwind CSS avoided?
   - How long did it take?
